It's also common to feel anxious when you are discussing something that is important, difficult to discuss, or you are making changes that are very difficult for you.The most important thing I can tell you, though, is to discuss with your therapist this idea that you feel nervous and shaky. Some anxiety can actually help to motivate or lead you toward change. There are also level of anxiety that can be counterproductive, so it's a good thing to discuss. Personally, I can tell you that I would want my clients to tell me about anxiety they feel 100% of the time. That opens the dialog to discuss whether it is the level of anxiety that they want to sit with and learn about in discovering more about themselves and their experiences and/or whether they would like to do something to lessen the feeling of anxiety.Thanks for writing here.

You mentioned it has only been a couple of sessions. Your anxiety might subside as you continue to see your therapist and grow more comfortable with him/her.\\xa0Another reason why you might feel particularly nervous is perhaps you are not comfortable sharing things. As children, we might have bad experiences opening up to others. Someone might bully or ridicule us, and that experience can stay with us for a long time, making it extra scary to share our intimate feelings and thoughts with others. If this the case, as you continue with your sessions and have positive interactions with your therapists, this anxiety will subside with time and you will re-learn that it is safe to share.\\xa0And the last thought why you might feel the shakes is perhaps you know that you need to talk about some past experiences or memories that are uncomfortable and difficult.\\xa0Regardless of the reason, it might help you to bring up your nervousness in your session and share how you feel with your therapist. Having an open dialogue about your anxiety with your therapist can help you resolve some of that anxiety and built greater trust with your therapist.\"}},\n  '72aae472-0386-430b-8091-667963e86bec': {'input': {'question': 'Is it normal to go into therapy feeling nervous?'},\n   'feedback': [EvaluationResult(key='COT Contextual Accuracy', score=1, value='CORRECT', comment=\"The student's answer aligns with the context provided.

They can be intense, I will do my best to offer some suggestions or thoughts that I hope will be helpful to you. There could be a number of things occurring. Therapy is a delicate, private decision and I would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up, that you are working to figure this out, and make this work, it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional,\\xa0your continued \\xa0dedication and motivation will take you far. I would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist, if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on, maybe inform the therapist that \\xa0that you feel nervous and shaky. I am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes, if this can be obtained and well received. This is\\xa0YOUR time for healing and therapy should be a safe, supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers. If you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist, that would be my first suggestion, is to tell he or she how you are feeling. If they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward. If this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward. If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion, breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve, close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly, in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 5-10 seconds, then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private, and feel safe environment. When you begin, I suggest putting your hand on your stomach, over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths. I know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are\\xa0incredibly helpful. We often forget to breathe, especially when we\\xa0 are feeling anxious. You are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day. I hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases.

Questions starting with the word why can sometimes make people very uncomfortable because they may not explicitly know why they are asking for something or feeling a certain way. You can try communicating this way for just five minutes or so on until you feel as though you can restate what your girlfriend is saying and have her agree that you are recapturing the essence of what she is trying to communicateThen you can switch so she is listening to you trying to understand your experience. You could also start by talking about something that is important to you.Remember that stating that you follow or hear something that she is saying doesn\\'t mean that you agreeAlso, try sticking to one subject at a time. It\\'s difficult to really understand one topic if you are on to the next within just a minute or twoTry to use the word want or wish instead of need. Saying that you need something (or if your girlfriend would say that) that is not a need for safety or something like that can make whatever you are asking for sound like an obligation. That takes away from that whole motivation to change from inside the partner who is agreeing to change or try to changeSomething else to try would be using some sort of timeout. Consider this:Discuss the idea of using timeout before you actually need it and before the discussion starts. Timeout is a way to give each of you a way to calm down for five, 10, 15 minutes, or maybe even an hour. When there are a lot of emotions happening, each person gets wrapped up in protecting themselves from the emotions they are feeling and can lose track of what is actually going on in the conversation as compared to what they are perceiving.When using timeout, say to your girlfriend (or she can say to you) \"I need an hour before we can go back to this.\" Then actually come back to the discussion.Some people are very afraid to use this technique because in the past not talking about something right away meant that it never was returned to and was never resolved in any way. This is why the agreement is important before you need it.While it may be helpful to ask your girlfriend what it is she may want from you, it is you that would be in charge of deciding whether you want to make that change and putting it into practice.Try to remember that part of being in a couple is holding onto your own wants, wishes, and desires while recognizing those of your partner.As one final idea, consider spending about 15 minutes a week together where you are not problem-solving about anything, just connecting with one another.I encourage you to see a therapist who specializes in couples if you would like some more specific ideas for what is happening within each of you and between you.Best wishes!'}},\n  'f479a65a-98be-418e-bd40-77a7e1a61d5f': {'input': {'question': 'I want to become a better man'},\n   'feedback': [EvaluationResult(key='COT Contextual Accuracy', score=None, value=None, comment=\"Error evaluating run d9709eac-6abf-44fa-9b2e-2d6d6836a095: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for gpt-4 in organization org-yGejNetcUkMLCsQiZcwh2KJQ on tokens per min (TPM): Limit 10000, Used 9702, Requested 789.

Continue to ask if she has more to add until she doesn\\'t.2. Validating. You tell her you you understanding why she feels this way. (If you don\\'t understand, then find a way.) You can also say, \"That makes sense\" or \"I hear you\" or \"I get that.\"3. Empathizing. Tell her how you think she must feel about what she\\'s telling you.

Summarize what you're hearing after every couple of minutes to make sure that you're not missing anything.4. Ask your partner what she needs from you.

First, I want to say that it is great that you are are willing to admit that you share some responsibility in some of the relationship problems you are having. This isn't always easy to do, but it sure is important if you want to see improvement. It does sound cliche, but communication really is the bedrock of relationships. And not just intimate partner relationships, but really any relationship that is significant to us. It sounds like you are saying that you have a difficult time really listening to what your partner is telling you and then responding in a way that is helpful. I want to tell you that you are not alone. Good communication skills are not really something you are born with, we actually have to learn them. The good news is that there is great information available to help you do that. Ultimately, some people must seek professional help through couple's counseling in order to get help with this process. This is because some of the hurt and anger could be at such a level already that you may need help setting boundaries, creating a plan, learning new skills, and staying on track. If that is not something you can afford or can do right now, here are a few suggestions that may help. Personally, I am big fan of Dr. John Gottman. He is an expert in relationships and wrote a really great, easy-to-read book called The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work. Dr. Gottman discusses the kind of communication that healthy couples seem to have, which can be helpful and worth trying. You can buy Dr. Gottman's book on Amazon for under $9. It's a good deal. There are a variety of websites that have good information that may help you build your communication. Here is one that I found that has a few good tips. http://www.helpguide.org/articles/relationships/effective-communication.htm You can try them and see if they are helpful. ***It is important to remember that like all new skills, communication requires practice and we surely fail several times before we start getting good at it. If you were ever a pitcher in baseball, then you know you have to throw thousands of pitches before you really start hitting your strike zone consistently. Allow yourself to make mistakes, own them, and start again. I hope these suggestions help, and good luck.Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC\"}},\n  '74f13dad-aa59-4c3c-9b14-cd9f5b07bb62': {'input': {'question': 'I want to become a better man'},\n   'feedback': [EvaluationResult(key='COT Contextual Accuracy', score=0, value='INCORRECT', comment=\"The student's answer is not directly addressing the context provided.

Understand the reasons behind the cheating: It's important to have open and honest discussions about why your husband cheated. This will help you determine if there are underlying issues that need to be addressed to prevent a recurrence in the future.\\n\\n3. Evaluate the pattern of cheating: If your husband has cheated multiple times, it may be necessary to reevaluate your reasons for staying in the marriage. Repeat offenses may indicate a lack of genuine remorse and a higher likelihood of future infidelity.\\n\\n4. Seek professional help: Consider seeing a marriage counselor or therapist who specializes in infidelity. They can provide guidance and support as you work through your emotions and help you both rebuild trust and heal.\\n\\n5.

Understand that it's normal to feel hurt, angry, and uncertain about the future. Be patient with yourself as you navigate through these emotions.\\n\\n6. Communicate openly: Be upfront with your feelings and concerns. Express your needs and expectations to your husband, and encourage him to do the same.

It may take awhile to reestablish your trust with him and he should understand this.\\xa0It's also very important to discuss WHY he cheated. You want to make sure that the reasoning behind this was not something that could arise again in the future. And if it can, there needs to be an action plan in place (i.e. being honest with how he's feeling) so that you both get a chance to rectify the situation.If the cheating has happened more than once, you may want to reevaluate your reasoning for staying in the marriage. It would be obvious that he did not truly regret what he had done or else he wouldn't repeat the same mistake. However, if it was a single event and he has shown you and continuously shows you that he genuinely loves you and is sorry for his mistake, I would give it a try. People do make mistakes and sometimes it takes an event like this to realize what you have.Know that it takes time and that you have the right to feel what you feel. If the relationship was a good, healthy relationship, it is worth saving. Ease back into it and be upfront with your feelings.

It sounds like you\\'re concerned about what happens when you drink too much and I suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not. I imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an \"addict\" or \"alcoholic.\" You might have a \"problem\" but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict.\\xa0I don\\'t have information to know if \"addiction\" or \"dependence\" or other words would best describe where you are with drinking, but it sounds like it\\'s begun to have some negatives, so forgive me using words like addict, dependence and so on. I mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis. The feedback I\\'m writing here is very general and doesn\\'t address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation. \\xa0One of the ways to think about substance (mis)use is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance. Let me repeat that: it is a disease of avoidance. Your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what you\\'re avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings, experiences, and so on. And of course, along the way, you may want to look at triggers, situations, biological vulnerability, social pressures, coping skills, relapse prevention planning and so on. Depending on where you are in your drinking, you might very well benefit from expertise and support.\\xa0Remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us. That means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax, destress, calm down, etc. Also, it allows feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed. If you were unfaithful and often angry, that\\'s your first signpost. For angry drinkers, it is often true that you don\\'t drink and then get angry, you drink in order to express anger.\\xa0I recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with, who is knowledgeable about addiction. Wishing you the best health and wellness.'}},\n  'e3f7d665-d7c6-4f8c-a3e8-ac68dc0c93e7': {'input': {'question': 'How do I stop grieving my mother’s death?'},\n   'feedback': [EvaluationResult(key='COT Contextual Accuracy', score=None, value=None, comment=\"Error evaluating run 22636e00-f1fa-45a1-a664-cdda9eabd4b8: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for gpt-4 in organization org-yGejNetcUkMLCsQiZcwh2KJQ on tokens per min (TPM): Limit 10000, Used 9895, Requested 1428.

That is why I am not surprised that you are a year in to this relationship and are just now noticing these behaviors. Some people actually don\\'t see them until they are already married! You didn\\'t mention that there has been any physical abuse, but I would warn you that this is sometimes a possibility once a person has already begun to be emotionally abusive. Other things to watch out for is your boyfriend trying to control who you hang out with, what you do and how you dress, etc. These are just more examples of emotional abuse and control. Here are some things to consider and some ideas:1. You could talk to your boyfriend about this behavior, if you believe it is safe to do so. Perhaps he will recognize that his behavior is not okay, and change. If not, then you may need to decide what you want to do about this relationship, given the fact that you cannot force him to change. 2. You can call a local domestic violence program. They do not only work with people who have been physically abused\\xa0or have been married. They are trained to talk about emotional abuse, also. It may be a good thing for support. Your calls are confidential. 3. Check out the wheel in the link below. On it you will find some other common ways that abuse can happen in a relationship. If any of these are happening to you, or begin to happen, talking to a domestic violence program, a trusted friend or family member, or\\xa0a counselor would be a good idea.\\xa0http://www.domesticviolence-wilm.org/Portals/97/Images/violence_wheel.gif\\xa0 Be well....

If having sex 4 to 5 times in the course of your relationship is satisfying to you and your husband, there is nothing wrong with it. If you or your husband would like to have sex more often, I suggest talking with a counselor about this to find ways to engage in a sexual life in which you are both satisfied.

There can be several reasons why this connection persists:\\n\\n1. Hope for change: Sometimes, we hold onto the hope that our ex will change and go back to how they used to be. We may remember the good times and believe that things can go back to the way they were. However, it's important to recognize that people tend to show more of who they are as time goes on, not less. Accepting them for who they are and letting go of the expectation for change can help in moving forward.\\n\\n2. Fear of the unknown: The idea of your ex being with someone new can be painful and create feelings of insecurity and inadequacy. It's normal to wonder if they will be a better person for their next partner. However, it's important to remember that their actions and choices are not a reflection of your worth. You deserve healing, better treatment, and apologies, but expecting that from someone who has hurt you may not be realistic.\\n\\n3. Self-blame: Sometimes, we may blame ourselves for the hurt caused by our exes. This belief can make it difficult to let go because we feel responsible for their actions. It's important to draw a line and recognize that their behaviors are about them, not you. Challenging and reducing thoughts of them, creating distance, and focusing on self-care can help in moving forward.\\n\\nRemember, healing takes time, and it's okay to seek support from a therapist if you feel it would be helpful.

For some people, honestly, it\\'s a game... to see how much power they have over you or it\\'s their need to control you. If you don\\'t want contact from this person, it\\'s really important to give him clear messages about boundaries (\"Don\\'t contact me again\"), and then ignore all of their communications. Any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour. Remind yourself why you don\\'t want to be with them. I hear you doing that already when you say \"he has nothing to offer me\". That\\'s great self-talk.But let\\'s get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this. Sometimes it\\'s because we still hope they will change. Maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us, and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those \"good old days\". The problem there is that, over the first few years, as intimacy grows, people tend to show more of who they are, not less. So what they\\'re eventually showing you is who they are and what they\\'re capable of. People do change and grow, but it won\\'t happen at your pace. Accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change.\\xa0Another reason we can\\'t let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life. This is a normal... but not a healthy... thought. It\\'s as though we want them to stay, maybe apologize, and heal our hurts; maybe make up for past mistakes. You deserve that healing, you deserve better than you got, you deserve apologies, but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasn\\'t demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy.\\xa0It is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused. If you blame yourself in any way for someone\\'s poor treatment of you, you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better. It will be impossible to let go, because you blame yourself for their behaviours.Draw a line. Their behaviours are about them, not you, and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them, and create physical and emotional distance.

Recovering from one is a process that is unique for everyone person and will take time. It\\'s important that you don\\'t compare yourself to others. Each and every person will experience this grieving process differently. Here are a few tips to help with your recovery:\\xa01. Make sure you surround yourself with people who love you and support you, friends and family. Even though you might feel like being alone, make an effort to be around them.\\xa02. Although you might not feel like it, try to take care of yourself as much as possible: eat healthily, get regular sleep, & vigorous or gentle exercise (depending on your mood). The last thing that we want to do when we are physically sick (e.g. flu) is to take care of ourselves even thought that\\'s what we need the most. But when we do get that chicken broth, sleep and vitamins we recover much faster and with less discomfort. That\\'s exactly the same when it comes to emotional\\xa0pain. Take care of yourself, keep\\xa0yourself strong and healthy so you can recover faster.\\xa03. As much as possible, put away reminders of the relationship. You might not be ready to throw things out, but try to put them away in a box in the storage or in a closet. And also block Social Media reminders. There is a lot of wisdom in the saying \"Out of Sight, Out of Mind.\"\\xa04. Once the initial shock and intensity of the break up wear off, try out something new. In a relationship, we often forget and give up on things that we always wanted to do or to try. Now it\\'s time to bring out that dusty bucket list and start trying something new.\\xa05. If possible, change your scenery by going away on vacation with a friend or even by yourself. Changing your surroundings can really help you change your thoughts, mindset\\xa0and forget your ex even if just for a few hours. Even a weekend getaway with a couple of girlfriends can do wonders.\\xa06. In addition, to help you make sense of your past relationship and what went wrong, I would highly recommend seeing a professional counsellor or therapist.'}},\n  '3a63c4b1-8c36-4a58-970f-b1a6b6831e6f': {'input': {'question': 'How do I move on?'},\n   'feedback': [EvaluationResult(key='COT Contextual Accuracy', score=None, value=None, comment=\"Error evaluating run 6a1c9155-9ad0-48a2-aeb2-6821f33a81d9: Error code: 429 - {'error': {'message': 'Rate limit reached for gpt-4 in organization org-yGejNetcUkMLCsQiZcwh2KJQ on tokens per min (TPM): Limit 10000, Used 9601, Requested 953.

We have high hopes and then those hopes and dreams are dashed and we feel at a loss for how to deal with this sudden change in our lives. First, it is important to acknowledge that losing a relationship is a loss and we need to grieve that loss. If we don't allow ourselves time to process and move through the grieving process, we may remain stuck and it may make it hard to move on. So in some ways, you don't want to move on too soon by just trying to ignore your feelings. Instead, take good care of yourself, talk to friends and give your self time to heal. The second most important thing is to forgive yourself; this is also an important part of taking care of yourself. You might be blaming yourself and re-living moments when you wish you would have done things differently. By replaying those thoughts you remain stuck. When we begin to forgive ourselves, we truly begin to heal. Lastly, in my experience the people who have the most difficulty moving on have not really severed all ties with their ex. They are still following them on social media or even checking in with texts. This is probably the hardest part for some people, but to move forward there needs to be a clear boundary and a clear ending. If you have a clear ending, you can have a new beginning.

Make sure you are eating well, exercising, and getting enough sleep. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who can provide emotional support.\\n\\n3. Avoid reminders: Put away reminders of the relationship as much as possible. This could mean storing items in a box or blocking social media reminders. The saying \"Out of sight, out of mind\" can be helpful in this situation.\\n\\n4. Try new things: Once the initial shock of the breakup wears off, try engaging in new activities or hobbies. Rediscover things you enjoy or explore new interests. This can help shift your focus and create a sense of excitement and fulfillment.\\n\\n5. Change your surroundings: Consider changing your environment by going on a vacation or taking a weekend getaway with friends. Changing your surroundings can help shift your mindset and provide a fresh perspective.\\n\\n6.
